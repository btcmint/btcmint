# Developer Documentation 🛠️

BTCMINT is not just a token – it is the **kernel** of a modular, permissionless DeFi operating system.  
Like an open-source OS for finance, BTCMINT provides a stable, auditable base layer where developers can deploy “apps” in the form of modules – curated and governed by the DAO.  
Every line of code is reproducible, every function transparent, every extension optional.

This chapter delivers:
- The **Core Contract API** as an immutable foundation  
- A **Module Blueprint** for permissionless extensions  
- **Deployment Workflows** for rapid iteration  
- **Security & Governance Principles** that empower trust and sutainability.

## 🔌 Core Contract Interface

BTCMINT is implemented as a minimal, immutable ERC‑20 with burn capability.  
It is the native asset for all modules in the BTCMINT ecosystem.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Burnable.sol";

contract BTCMINT is ERC20, ERC20Burnable {
    constructor() ERC20("Bitcoin Mint", "BTCMINT") {
        _mint(msg.sender, 21_000_000 * 10 ** decimals());
    }
}
```

### Key Properties

*   🔒 **Fixed Supply**: 21 M BTCMINT, minted once at deployment
    
*   🔥 **Burnable**: Deflationary mechanic via burn()
    
*   🌐 **ERC‑20 Standard**: Compatible with wallets, aggregators, and DeFi protocols
    
*   🛡️ **Immutable**: No hidden mint functions, no upgradeable proxy
    

### Exposed Functions

*   transfer, approve, transferFrom — Standard ERC‑20
    
*   burn(uint256 amount) — Deflationary control
    

### Events

*   Transfer, Approval — ERC‑20 compliant
    
*   Burn — Emitted on deflationary actions
    

🧩 Module Blueprint
-------------------

BTCMINT modules are like system apps: they extend the kernel with new capabilities without altering the core.Every module is opt‑in, DAO‑approved, and permissionless to develop.

### How to Build a Module

1.  Inherit from BaseModule – Ensures registry compatibility
    
2.  Implement onActivate() – Initialize state and permissions
    
3.  Expose minimal public functions – Clean, composable interfaces
    
4.  Emit events – For off‑chain indexing and transparency
    
5.  Submit to DAO Registry – Community votes on inclusion
    

### Example Modules

*   TimeLockMint – Delayed minting via DAO vote
    
*   CommunityBurn – Token burn triggered by governance
    
*   AirdropDistributor – Permissionless claim drops
    
*   RouletteModule – On‑chain game with BTCMINT wagers & treasury split
    

> **Philosophy**: BTCMINT is the kernel. Modules are the apps. The DAO is the sysadmin.

🚀 Testing & Deployment
-----------------------

BTCMINT & modules are compatible with Hardhat and Foundry.

### Hardhat Setup

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network polygon
```

### Foundry Setup

```bash
forge init
forge build
forge test
forge script DeployBTCMINT --rpc-url $POLYGON_RPC --broadcast
```

### Best Practices

*   Deterministic deployment with CREATE2
    
*   Freeze environments with package-lock.json or foundry.toml
    
*   Verify contracts on Polygonscan with exact compiler settings
    
*   Use Mumbai testnet for module prototyping
    

🔐 Security & Governance Principles
-----------------------------------

Security in BTCMINT is both technical and social:Technical through minimal, audited code. Social through DAO control and opt‑in modules.

### Security Guidelines

*   No upgradeable proxies without full DAO decentralization
    
*   Use OpenZeppelin only when necessary – strip unused logic
    
*   Constructor parameters must be immutable & publicly visible
    
*   Emit events for every state‑changing action
    
*   Use require() with clear error messages
    

### Audit Checklist

*   ✅ Bytecode matches verified source
    
*   ✅ No hidden mint/burn backdoors
    
*   ✅ All modules are opt‑in & DAO‑approved
    
*   ✅ Supply mechanics are transparent & immutable
    
*   ✅ External calls minimized & sandboxed
    

🧠 Developer Ethos
------------------

BTCMINT is built for builders.Every module is a chance to extend the kernel, activate new financial primitives, and shape the future of open‑source finance.

> “Don’t just deploy a token. Deploy a system.”

Fork the kernel. Build a module. Let the DAO decide.BTCMINT is your tool – and the community is your multiplier.
