# BTCMINT – Introduction

## 🚀 What is BTCMINT?

BTCMINT is a permissionless module framework built on Polygon that enables scalable token ecosystems — with governance, Wallet Connect, token gating, and auditable supply mechanics.  
It merges the scarcity ethos of Bitcoin with the speed and eco-efficiency of Polygon, offering a trustless foundation for modular innovation.

> Bitcoin’s soul, Polygon’s speed.

## 🌐 Mission & Vision

Our mission is to build a transparent, auditable, and extensible ecosystem that enables innovation rather than restricts it.  
BTCMINT stands for modularity, security, and openness — like a GNU/Linux for Web3.  
We envision a future where anyone can launch, extend, and govern digital assets without gatekeepers, using verified modules and community-driven governance.

## 🧩 Quick Overview

BTCMINT consists of three core components:

- **🔗 Token Layer — Bitcoin’s Soul, Polygon’s Speed**

BTCMINT is a minimalist ERC-20 token with maximal intent.

- Embodies Bitcoin’s scarcity, credibility, and trustless design
- Runs on Polygon for blazing speed, low fees, and eco-efficiency
- Planned gas-free experience via upcoming subsidized transaction module
- Transparent supply allocation with tranche-level wallet architecture
- Optional burn mechanics for dynamic scarcity and deflationary control
- Native support for WalletConnect, token gating, and module activation
- Designed for forensic traceability and DAO-ready governance

BTCMINT isn’t just a token — it’s the sovereign kernel of a permissionless future.

- **Module Registry**  
  Every feature — from NFT certificates to KYC integrations — is implemented as an independent module. Modules can be activated permissionless and governed transparently.

- **Governance Framework**  
  A DAO-based system for managing modules, treasury, and proposals. Includes role definitions, quorum logic, and lifecycle tracking for community decisions.
