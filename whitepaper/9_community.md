## 🌐 Community & Support  
_The BTCMINT network is only as strong as its builders, voters, and protectors._

### Channel  
There’s one place where it all happens:  
- **Discord** — Developer hub, module drops, live support, and build‑in‑public sessions.  
  [Join here →](https://discord.gg/wNyf84bv)

### Contribution Guide  
BTCMINT is permissionless — if you can build it, you can ship it.  
1. **Fork the repo** — Start from the kernel or an existing module.  
2. **Follow the module schema** — Ensure registry compatibility and DAO discoverability.  
3. **Submit a PR** — Earn reputation, unlock governance weight, and qualify for contributor rewards.  
4. *Modules that pass DAO review are added to the Registry and become part of the official BTCMINT OS.*

> Every merged PR strengthens the kernel. Every module expands the ecosystem.

### Bug Bounty  
Security is a shared responsibility.  
- **Report vulnerabilities** through the official bounty program.  
- **Earn rewards** for valid disclosures.  
- **Protect the mint** — keep the core immutable and the modules safe.  
- *Rewards scale by severity — from UI bugs to critical kernel exploits.*

*This is your ecosystem. Fork it. Shape it. Defend it. The DAO is the sysadmin — but the community is the operating system.*
