# Bitcoin Mint (BTCMINT) Tokenlist & Kernel

**Bitcoin’s soul, Polygon’s speed.**  
BTCMINT is a permissionless, modular DeFi kernel on Polygon – inspired by the scarcity of Bitcoin and the efficiency of Polygon.  
This repository contains the official token list and serves as an entry point for developers, integrators, and community members.

## 🧩 Core Principles

- **Minimalism = Auditability** → simple, verified ERC‑20 with no hidden functions  
- **Modularity** → features like staking, governance, and bridges as optional modules  
- **Permissionless Innovation** → anyone can build modules, DAO decides activation  
- **Community Ownership** → governance and treasury progressively decentralized
